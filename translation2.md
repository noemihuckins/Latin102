William Faulkner’s novel As I lay dying takes its title from an English translation of a single word in Odyssey 11.424. In Greek, where participles function very differently from English but similarly to Latin, that word is a present active participle.

C. Translation 
Deianira, the wife of Hercules, was not able to go across the great river, to which was named Evenus, and the centaur Nessus, who was the son of Ixion and Nubes, was asked to help. This delighted Deianira, in the river she wanted to injure herself. Hither when Hercules (might have) intervened with faith and Deianira (might have) begged with tears when Nessus constructed arrows. 
When dying, he knew that the arrows of Hydra of Lerna were soaked in bile. Having great strength, he gave his blood only to Deianira and said this is a love potion.
