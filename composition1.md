Background story
(Based on chapter 35 of Hyginus)
Heracles travelled to the city of Oechalia in Aetolia, and asked the king, Eurytus, for permission to marry his daughter, Iole. 
When Eurytus refused, Heracles not only destroyed the city, but killed Iole’s parents before her very eyes. 
He then took Iole captive, and sent her to his home, to his wife Deianira (!)

Your composition should use all the vocabulary items listed below at least once.
Your first sentence should use a temporal clause to express that when Hercules came to Oechalia, he asked to marry Iole.

Your third sentence should express that Hercules said that he would kill her parents, and should include an indirect statement.
Your fourth sentence should say that Iole endured that her parents were killed.
